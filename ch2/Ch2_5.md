### Correlated random variables: suppose that the heights of husbands and wives have a correlation of 0.3. Let x and y be the heights of a married couple chosen at random. What are the mean and standard deviation of the average height, (x + y)/2?

X : denotes rv for the height of men

Y : denotes rv for the height of women

From exercise 4 we know that:

E[X] = 69.1  SD[X] = 2.9

E[X] = 63.7  SD[X] = 2.7

From the description of this exercise

rho = 0.3

Thus,

E[X+Y] = E[X] + E[Y]

STDEV[X + Y] = (SD[X]^2 + SD[Y]^2 + 2 \* rho \* SD[X] \* SD[Y])^{1/2}
